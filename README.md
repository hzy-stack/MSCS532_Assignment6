### Summary of Finding
Deterministic Quicksort consistently outperformed randomized Quicksort in this empirical run, particularly on sorted and reverse-sorted inputsâ€”an outcome that may vary depending on system-level randomness and implementation overhead.

The measured times suggest that for smaller arrays and specific pivot strategies, deterministic selection may offer a slight practical advantage. However, randomized Quicksort provides better guarantees in unpredictable or adversarial inputs, making it preferable in general-purpose libraries.
